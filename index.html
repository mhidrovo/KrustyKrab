                    Created in 1999 by entrepreneur Eugene H. Crabs, the

                    for an accessible price. The KrustyKrab is proud to

                    We appreciate your attention as clients, etc. etc. 
                    <br>

                    When it was just founded, the restaurant had two employees:
                    Spongebob Squarepants and Squidward Tentacles. Since then, 
                    business flourished, and the restaurant became known as 
                    "the finest eating establishment ever established for 
                    eating". Along with its multiple charitable events, the 
                    Krusty Krab acknowledges that is has a social 
                    responsibility and hopes to provide jobs to people in need
                    while awarding full scholarships to its employees' 
                    children. Click here to know how to be part of the change.
